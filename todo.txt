    Halting Problem
- Make link finding code alert the recipe processing code that it is done
- Make the recipe reading code alert the listener that it is done
- Make recipe reader code more obvious what is going on
- Make a thread count and keep a max to prevent too much memory loss (also put back on queue if it fails)

- BUG: Remove all spaces and order requirements possible in regexes
- BUG: Add trimming of white space from all fields

Milestone 1 reached!


- Refactor all function calls that will be similar for all readers, make it an interface (that is used)
- Make a web interface to view the recipes
- Add an updated field for recipes (to see if it's changed)
- Make the recipe adder know if the recipe is dirty or not
- Make a path to get the json version of recipes
- Allow getting getting only dirty recipes
- Allow confirmation of getting dirty recipes (and marking them clean)
